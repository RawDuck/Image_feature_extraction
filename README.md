# Selected features

1. Shape features (shape.py)
2. Signature shape descriptor (signature.py)
3. Color features (color.py)
4. UNL-Fourier descriptor (unlFourier.py)
5. 2D-Fourier descriptor (fourier.py)
6. Grayscale-Fourier (grayscale_fourier.py)
7. Some grayscale descriptors (grayOwn.py)

It is worth to mention that whole code has been improved in each iteration. Shape features is the first version, some grayscale descriptors is the last one.
